            <h2>The Family Business</h2>
            <p>
            I've been an animal lover my entire life. My family owned a tropical fish and pet supply store, and we also sold small animals, like guinea pigs,
            turtles, hamsters, birds and rabbits. I was lucky that, whenever I wanted a new pet, I was allowed to have one. We also had dogs and they were my 
            favorites. I can't ever rememember a time in my life when I didn't have at least two animals hanging out in my room. I was a pretty lucky kid!

<h2>My Better Half</h2>
<p>
When I got older and got my own place, for several years, it was just me and my partner in crime, Scotty.  Mentally, he's a person, obviously. Physically, he's a combination
of a squirrel, a small deer and a dog. It's fun to watch him run!</p>

        <h2>Cat &#35;1</h2>
        <p>
        And then something changed. I moved from Chicago to Missouri, and for the first time in my life,
        I learned what an "outdoor" cat was! Growing up, people either had indoor cats they loved, or they didn't have cats at all. But when I moved in with my
        soon to be husband, I saw my first outdoor cat.  He was beautiful, orange and white with long hair and he was very comfortable at our house. For about a year,
        he would come by once or twice a day, and we would sit on the front steps chatting about life.  My husband was convinced that he belongd to someone, AndI felt
        increasing strongly that the people he belonged to didn't deserve him. Didn't they know what could happen to a cat on the street? There are dogs, foxes,
        coyotes, mean people, cars....the more I thought about it, the more it bothered me.  That winter, I didn't see him for a couple of weeks and I was a wreck.
        I drove around looking for him, I put extra food outside to lure him. When he finally showed up, that was it for me. I put a collar around his neck with a note that
        said "if this is your cat, call me." and my number. A few hours later, a neighbor called and told me that he, and the people across the street from him,
        had been looking out for this cat for several years. They fed him, they brought him inside when the weather was bad. I told the neighbor he would never see that
        cat again, because we were adopting him. And that's how Tanner joined our family.

                <h2>My Complete Family...Sort Of!</h2>
                <p>
            Over the next few years, we added 5 more cats in almost the exact same way and before I knew it, I had my own litter :) This is one our first training sessions where we
            went from open feeding (where food is left on the table and they can graze all day) to timed feeding, because the open feeding led to one of the cats having a weight problem.
            I'm not sure who's training who! Right now, every time I go in to the kitchen, I get attacked! As you can see, our dog it also being re-trained :)

           <h2>The Future?</h2>
           <p>
       Lately, a new mom and her kittens have been hanging around. I thought I might start putting food out to build a relationship with them, so that I
       can get close enough to grab them and take them to the vet for treatment. This morning, a new breed of kitty tried to join the family! I don't mind,
       but I don't think the vet will want to see him :)
